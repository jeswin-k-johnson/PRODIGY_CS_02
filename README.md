# PRODIGY_CS_02

Develop a simple image encryption
tool using pixel manipulation. You can
perform operations like swapping
pixel values or applying a basic
mathematical operation to each pixel.
Allow users to encrypt and decrypt
images.

## Overview:

This project is a simple image encryption tool developed using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic operations on pixel values. The encryption and decryption processes ensure that the image data is transformed in a way that is reversible, allowing the original image to be restored.

#### Features Image Encryption: Encrypts an image by altering its pixel values through various operations. 
#### Image Decryption: Reverses the encryption process to restore the original image. 
#### User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for users to select images, encrypt, and decrypt them.         
How It Works Pixel Manipulation Techniques The tool uses basic pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images.
